                  <p class="bespoketext1"> For this project Hallmark asked me to design a gift giving/receiving experience for two fictional people, who live far away from each other. The idea is, that the sender wants to create a personalized card for the other one through
                    Hallmark's card personalization tool. Besides that the sender will also prepare a digital unwrapping of an intangible gift for the receiver. My task was it, to come up with a story for the sender and receiver and design a prototype of the card as well as the digital unwrapping of the gift.</p>

                  <p>In my case the sender is Julia and the receiver is her boyfriend Karl. She is doing an internship abroad and wants to show her boyfriend, that she really misses him and cares a lot about him. Based on information about him and his gift receiving preferences, she then
                    decides to create a personalized card for Karl through Hallmark's card personalization tool and prepares the digital unwrapping. The card she creates has a heart and a digital lock on it, which has to be unlocked by Karl, to open it up.
                    The card also has a music player, that plays Karl's most favorite song and qr-code on the back, which Karl has to scan with the app "Hallmark's Quiz" and then starts the digital unwrapping. As an intangible gift, she wants to give him tickets to his most favourite band and join him to that concert.
                    With the app "Hallmark's Quiz" she creates the digital unwrapping for him in the form of a quiz about their relationship. At the end of the quiz the app reveals, that Karl got two tickets to the concert and Julia is joining him. <p>
